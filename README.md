# Predicting Medical Expenses

This project aims to develop an automated system for estimating the annual medical expenditures for new customers of ACME Insurance Inc. By analyzing historical data, the system predicts insurance premiums based on customer demographics and health-related factors.

## Problem Statement

ACME Insurance Inc. provides affordable health insurance to thousands of customers across the United States. As the lead data scientist, you are tasked with creating a model that can predict annual medical expenditures using various customer attributes, such as:

- Age
- Sex
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Number of children
- Smoking habits
- Region of residence

The predictions will be used to determine the annual insurance premium for each customer. Additionally, due to regulatory requirements, the system must provide explanations for its predictions.

## Dataset

- `bmi`: Body mass index
- `children`: Number of children/dependents covered by insurance
- `smoker`: Smoking status (yes/no)
- `region`: Customer's region of residence
- `charges`: Actual medical charges incurred

The dataset contains information from over 1300 customers.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need Python installed along with the following libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- 'Linear Regression'
